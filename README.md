# RCMP

RCMP is a low-maintenance VCS push notification IRC bot with support for
GitHub, Bitbucket and Travis CI.

## Usage

RCMP accepts webhook POSTs on the following URLs:

 * `/`: Notification will be sent to default server and channel (see
   [Configuration](#configuration))
 * `/:channel`: Notification will be sent to `:channel` on default
   server
 * `/:server/:channel`: Notification will be sent to `:channel` on
   `:server`

For all endpoints, `:channel` is the channel name without the leading
`#`. For channels with two leading hashes, the second must be URL
encoded, i.e. `%23`. `:server` is either a server address (e.g.
`irc.freenode.net`) or a server name/alias (e.g. `freenode` or `fn`).
See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

### GitHub

Add the WebHook URL to the Service Hooks in your repository's Settings.

### Bitbucket

Add a POST Hook in your repository's Administration page.

### Travis CI

Add the following to your project's `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  webhooks:
    - http://rcmp.instance/server/channel
```

```

## Set up

First, fetch the dependencies using Bundler:

```sh
bundle install
```

Start RCMP using Rack's `rackup` command.

### Configuration

RCMP loads server configuration from the YAML file specified in the
`CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, or by default `rcmp.yml`.

The configuration file format is the following:

```yaml
irc:
  servers:
    name:
      address: irc.example.com
      port: 6667 # optional
      nick: RCMP
      nickserv: password # optional
      alias: # optional
        - example
        - ex
    othername:
      # ...
```

The configuration file must contain at least one server named `default`,
which will be the default destination for notifications. This server
must also contain a `channel` key which will be the default channel for
notifications.
